# Product Context - FBPyUtils-DB

## Why This Project Exists
FBPyUtils-DB was created to address common challenges in database data processing workflows, particularly when working with pandas DataFrames and database tables that require consistent formatting and integrity verification.

## Problems It Solves
- **Data Consistency**: Ensures consistent column naming and data formatting across different data sources
- **Data Integrity**: Provides hashing mechanisms to verify data hasn't been tampered with
- **Visualization**: Offers clean ASCII table formatting for terminal/console output
- **Development Efficiency**: Reduces boilerplate code for common database operations

## How It Should Work
The library provides a collection of utility functions that can be imported and used as needed:
- Import specific functions for targeted operations
- Chain operations together for complex workflows
- Work seamlessly with pandas DataFrames
- Provide clear error messages and logging

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: Easy to use with minimal setup required
- **Flexibility**: Functions work with various data formats and sources
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures stable behavior
- **Documentation**: Clear examples and API documentation for all functions
